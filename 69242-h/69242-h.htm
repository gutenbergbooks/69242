<p>Children love pets; they never
tire of stories; and they are delighted
with jingle and the fun of
incongruity. Mother Goose reigns
supreme in the fairy-land of infancy.
Through these loves the
little opening minds may be led
to careful observation, comparison, and descriptions—steps
at once necessary to mental growth,
and leading up to the portals of science. By insensible
degrees, play may be made to merge in
study, and fun take on the form of fact.</p>

<div class="figright illowp75" id="illus05" style="max-width: 9.375em;">

<p>Upon these ideas of the basis and method of
thought, this little work has
been constructed. A few familiar
nursery-rhymes serve to connect
the present with the past
thought of the child. The pet
of the household—the cat—is
studied. From the obvious in
structure and movement, the mind is led to see
relations, and the adaptations of structure to functions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
and outward conditions. As each new animal
is introduced, the study goes on by comparisons,
showing resemblances and differences, and
pointing toward scientific classifications.</p>

<p>This and kindred works will be of little use,
however, if the lessons stop with the book. The
whole intent of the method is to incite to a study
of the animals themselves—the matter in the book
directing attention, arousing interest, and serving
as a guide to observation.</p>

<p>An endeavor has been made to present the
pleasant side of animal life. To this end the
affection, the intelligence, and the uses of our
servants and friends have been dwelt upon, and
ideas of violence have received but a passing
notice. That we should be kind to animals is a
necessary inference from observed relations, and
this obviates the necessity of a formal exhortation
or a cut-and-dried moral.</p>

<p>As a reader, this book is designed to supplement
the regular reader of the grade. Common
and familiar language is used, but no effort has
been made to reduce the expressions to baby-talk,
or to construct halting sentences with words of
three or four letters only.</p>

<p>1. Come, Jessie! put your kitty up in the cradle,
and take a good look at her. She looks very
pleasant. Can you tell us anything about her?</p>

<p>2. Yes! the other day I saw her come out of
the barn with a mouse in her mouth.</p>

<p>3. She would lay the mouse down and let it
run a little way, and then would pounce upon it
and catch it again.</p>

<p>4. By-and-by she got tired of playing with it,
and then she bit off its head and ate it up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>5. One day I saw her creep slyly along the
ground and spring upon a little bird; but it flew
away out of her reach. In a little while I heard
it sing up in a tree.</p>

<p>6. I was glad that she did not catch the bird,
but she looked sorry. When she catches birds, I
think she is a naughty pussy; but perhaps she
does not know any better.</p>

<p>7. I like to hear her purr, and have her rub
against my hand, for then she is good and ready
to play. It is great fun to see her run round after
her tail.</p>

<p>8. But sometimes she growls and looks cross,
and then I am afraid to touch her for fear she
will scratch me.</p>

<p>9. When she is hungry she comes and mews
until she gets something to eat. Some cats will
jump upon the table and steal meat, but my kitty
knows better.</p>

<p>10. She does not like dogs. One day a strange
dog came into the yard and barked at her.</p>

<p>11. Then her back came up, her fur stood out
straight, and she growled and spit at him.</p>

<p>12. When he tried to bite her, she gave him a
scratch on both sides of his nose, and ran up a tree
out of his reach.</p>

<h3><i>THE GRATEFUL CAT.</i></h3>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus10" style="max-width: 31.25em;">

</div>

<p>1. A lady tells this pretty story of how a cat
showed its thanks to a kind friend who had helped
it in distress:</p>

<p>2. While living in a country place, one day
the cat ate some rat-poison, but not enough to
kill it. It was very ill, and cried like a little
child. Its pain and heat were so great that it
would dip its paws in water to cool them, though
cats nearly always keep away from the water.</p>

<p>3. At last it went to the lady, and, mewing
and looking up to her in a most pitiful way,
seemed to ask for help. The lady took the poor
thing in her arms, and tried in all ways she could
think of to relieve it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>4. She bound it up in cool, wet cloths, and
gave it medicine and gruel, and took care of it all
day and night. The cat was soon better, and after
a day or two it was as well as ever; and this was
the way it took to show how thankful it was to
the lady for her kindness:</p>

<p>5. One night, after she had gone up-stairs, she
heard a mew at the window; and, upon opening
it, there was the cat with a mouse in its mouth.</p>

<p>6. It had climbed up a tree that grew against
the house, and, when the window opened, it came
in and laid the mouse at the lady’s feet. It rubbed
against her, and purred loudly, as if it said, “See
what a fine mouse I have brought you!”</p>

<p>7. The cat thought a mouse the best of all
things, and this best it gave up for itself, and
brought to its best friend, the lady.</p>

<p>8. This she did for a long time every day, and
when, afterward, she caught mice for her kittens,
one mouse was laid aside for the lady. If the kittens
tried to eat this, she gave them a little pat, as
if she said, “That is not for you.”</p>

<p>9. After a while the lady would take the
mouse, and thank puss with a pleased look and a
kind tone, and then give it to the kittens, the cat
looking on well pleased while they ate it.</p>

</div>

<p>1. Come, Jessie,
take your cat in
your lap and look at her
again. Can you tell something
more about her?</p>

<p>2. Yes! Pussy has a thick coat of
soft fur to keep her warm, so that she
can run out of doors in cold weather.</p>

<p>3. She does not need to have clothes
like ours, and mamma does not ever have to mend
her coat. Her fur all grows one way, and it is so
thick that, when it rains, the water runs off and
does not wet her skin unless it rains hard.</p>

<p>4. She likes to have me stroke her from her
head down, but she does not like to be rubbed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
other way. I know for one that it hurts more to
have the hair pulled up than down.</p>

<p>5. She has long whiskers on each side of her
mouth and nose, and some folks call them smellers.
This is what I read about them in the
“Cat’s Picture-Book”:</p>

<p>6. “I dare say you have seen a cat stick his
whiskers out straight on each side of his face. Let
us see what he does it for.</p>

<p>7. “Have you not seen a cat creep through a
hole that seemed too small for him? I have, and
I used to wonder why he did not stick fast.</p>

<p>8. “But Tom knows what he is about. He
comes to the hole and spreads out his whiskers, and
if they can get through without touching, he knows
there is room for his body, and so he goes on.”</p>

<p>9. Pussy’s ears are large and stand up straight,
so that she can hear the least nibble of a mouse, or
the sly tread of a rat.</p>

<p>10. She has paws on her fore legs which she
uses like hands. Her paws have each five toes,
but her hind feet have only four toes each. Some
few cats have more toes on each foot.</p>

<p>11. Dogs wag their tails when they are pleased,
but pussy waves hers from side to side when the
boys plague her, and she is angry.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus13.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>1. Patch was a fine old
cat that lived in a farm-house,
and looked after all
the rats and mice that
came about. She wanted to
visit all the rooms
where there were
mouse-holes; so she
learned to open
doors for herself.</p>

<p>2. When
she wanted
to go out,
she would
jump up
and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
hold on to the handle of the door with one paw,
and with the other raise the latch; then she would
drop down and push the door open.</p>

<p>3. One evening, as the lady of the house was
sitting at the fire before the candle was lit, Patch
came into the room with a live mouse, and began
to play with it.</p>

<p>4. The mouse watched his chance and ran into
the bedroom, the door of which stood open.
Patch followed, but could not catch him.</p>

<p>5. Pretty soon the cat came out of the bedroom
in a great hurry. She went to the lady and
mewed, and then went to the candle and back several
times. The lady thought the cat acted queerly,
and at last she got up and lit the candle.</p>

<p>6. Patch started off for the bedroom, and
looked back and mewed, as if asking the lady to
come also. The lady took the candle and went in
to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>7. The cat at once went up to a curtain, put
up her paw as far as she could reach, and touched
it. The lady shook the curtain, and down dropped
the mouse, which Patch caught at once. Mousey
had run up the curtain out of reach, and so Patch
went and got the lady to come and help her catch
it.</p>

</div>

<p>1. Tommy was a famous mouser, and he kept
the house clear of rats and mice. He would catch
birds, but he never ran after the chickens.</p>

<p>2. The hens were shy of him at first, but they
became used to him and would scratch just the
same while he was about. One day he was taking
a nap on the grass, and the chickens mounted upon
his back and head, as you see in the picture.</p>

<p>3. This was too much for Tom; so he got up
and went upon the porch to finish his nap, where
the chickens would not disturb him.</p>

<h3><i>HOW THE CAT MOVES.</i></h3>

<div class="figleft illowp100" id="illus15" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus15.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>1. Now, Jessie, look
at your kitty’s feet and
see if you can tell us
how she can catch mice
and birds so easily.</p>

<p>2. I will try. Pussy has long and sharp claws,
but they are drawn back into her foot, so I cannot
see them.</p>

<p>3. The bottoms of her feet are covered with a
thick skin, so that it does not hurt her to walk
over stones and rough places.</p>

<p>4. When I feel of her feet, I find that the bottoms
are soft, so that kitty is able to move about
without making a noise.</p>

<p>5. When she is hunting, she creeps along so
quietly that the mouse
does not hear her until
she is so near that she
can spring upon it.</p>

<div class="figright illowp100" id="illus16" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus16.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>6. Then her sharp
nails come out, as you
see in this picture, and
the little mouse is
caught by his coat and cannot get away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>7. I see that the nails upon her hind feet are
not so sharp as those on the front ones. She does
not catch mice with her hind feet, and so only the
nails of her fore feet need be very sharp.</p>

<p>8. When pussy runs up a tree, her sharp nails
hold on to the bark, and she uses her hind claws
as well as the fore ones. This is what I read in a
book a little while ago about a cat’s claws, and I
thought it very strange:</p>

<p>9. “The claws of a cat grow very fast, just
as our nails do, and, if the cat did not rub them off,
they would grow so long that she could not use
them. So, when the cat feels that her nails are
getting too long, she scratches something hard
until she wears them down to the right length.</p>

<p>10. “You have seen the cat stretching up and
scratching the side of the door or a tree: this is
the way she has of paring her nails.”</p>

<p>11. When pussy is angry or afraid, her sharp
claws come out of her foot, and she makes ready
to scratch.</p>

<p>12. My pussy knows that a dog is stronger in
the jaws than she is; and so, when a strange dog
comes about, she gives him a scratch with both
her paws, and then gets into some safe place as
soon as she can.</p>

</div>

<p>1. When Nellie was a little girl, she had a
present of a pretty white kitten, which she named
Daisy, and the two soon became good friends.</p>

<p>2. While Nellie was at breakfast, the kitten
would sit at her side, and once in a while it would
reach up and touch Nellie’s elbow, as if it said,
“It is my turn now.” When Nellie walked out,
Daisy went along like a little dog, and at night
she had a soft, warm bed by Nellie’s side.</p>

<p>3. Little girls used to come and play with Nellie,
and Daisy always took a part, and seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
enjoy the fun as much as the children did. One
of the games was hide-and-seek, and this Daisy
soon learned to play as well as the best of them.</p>

<p>4. After this, at any time when Nellie would
hide and call “coop,” the kitten would jump up
and look about until it found her.</p>

<p>5. When Daisy grew up and had a kitten of
her own, she taught the young one the game she
had learned. The kitten would go and hide and
give one mew, and the old cat would search in
every corner of the room until she found it.</p>

<p>6. Sometimes the mother-cat would pretend
not to see the kitten when close to its hiding-place,
and, when the kitten jumped out, Daisy
would start back as though scared, just as children
often do.</p>

<p>7. Then the two would roll over each other,
and race about and have a great romp together.</p>

<h3><i>HOW THE CAT EATS.</i></h3>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus19" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus19.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>1. This time, Jessie, I wish you would tell us
something about the mouth of your cat, if you are
not afraid she will bite you.</p>

<p>2. No! my kitty will not bite me; she knows
I will not hurt her. Come, pussy, open your
mouth and let me take a good look at it.</p>

<p>3. I see four long teeth in the front part of her
mouth. The two on the upper jaw are the larger,
but the two on the under jaw are the sharper.</p>

<p>4. When she shuts her jaws, these teeth would
easily go through the skin and flesh of a rat or
mouse, and very likely would break its bones.</p>

<p>5. Between these long teeth in front I can
count six funny little teeth on each jaw. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
are too small to be of much use. Back of her long
teeth I can see three or four on each jaw, and
these are sharp and stand up like saw-teeth.</p>

<p>6. When pussy licks my hand, I can feel that
her tongue is rough, and this is what I read about
it in my cat-book:</p>

<p>7. “The cat’s tongue is covered with little
hooks, all pointing backward, so that when the
food is in her mouth, the rough tongue helps her
swallow it. With this rough tongue she laps up
milk, licks the plate clean when she is fed, and
licks the meat off from bones.</p>

<p>8. “The dog’s jaws are strong, so he crushes
bones and eats the meat, bones and all; but the
cat’s jaws are not strong enough for that, so she
gets the meat off with her rough tongue.”</p>

<p>9. My pussy keeps clean by licking her fur, the
hooks on her tongue brushing the dirt off. It is
funny to see her wash her neck. She first licks
her paw and makes it wet, and then she reaches
up to her neck and uses her paw like a brush.</p>

<p>10. The old mother-cat licks her kittens all
over, and keeps them clean before they can do it
for themselves. She uses her jaws to carry her
kittens about before they can walk. She takes
them up carefully by the nape of their necks.</p>

<h3><i>OLD TOM AND THE EAGLE.</i></h3>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus20.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>1. I will now tell you a story of a cat that
made good use of his claws and teeth.</p>

<p>2. In a country place by the sea-shore an old
eagle used to sail around in the air looking for
something to eat.</p>

<p>3. If she saw a rabbit or a hare, or a little
lamb or kid, she would pounce down and seize
it in her strong claws, and fly away with it to her
nest high up among the rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>4. The eagle became so bold at last that she
would swoop down and carry off a chicken from
the farm-yard close by the house.</p>

<p>5. One day old Tom, the house-cat, a big old
fellow, went out to take a walk, and, as the weather
was warm, he lay down in the sun to take a nap
near by where the rabbits lived.</p>

<p>6. This old cat had done a great deal of hunting
on his own account, and was not afraid of anything
he had ever met.</p>

<p>7. The eagle saw Tom as he lay there asleep,
and thinking she had found a nice, fat rabbit, she
pounced down upon him and carried him off.</p>

<p>8. Tom awoke and found himself sailing
through the air at a great rate, while something
pinched him very unpleasantly in the back.</p>

<p>9. He turned and struck his sharp claws and
teeth into the eagle, tore out her feathers, and then
tore into her skin and flesh.</p>

<p>10. The eagle thought she had found a queer
rabbit, and tried to let him go; but Tom held on
and still tore and bit.</p>

<p>11. Soon the eagle began to lose strength and
flapped slowly downward. At last she reached
the ground so badly torn that she soon died, while
the cat ran off with only a few scratches.</p>

<p>1. Now, Jessie, will you
please tell us all that you
have found out about your
kitty’s eyes?</p>

<p>2. Yes! When I looked
at my pussy’s eyes, in the
bright sunshine, I saw that
they are round and yellow,
with a black streak in the middle running up and
down.</p>

<p>3. The black spot in the middle of my eye is
round, and I have read in a book that it is a hole
to let in the light, and is
called the “pupil.”</p>

<p>4. The black streak in
pussy’s eye is the pupil,
and it is almost shut up
to keep out the bright
light.</p>

<div class="figright illowp64" id="illus22" style="max-width: 9.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus22.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>5. I looked into her
eyes last night just before
dark, and the pupil was
large and round, as is shown in this picture.</p>

<p>6. When the pupil is opened so wide, more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
light is let in, and pussy can see very well when
it is so dark I can not see anything.</p>

<p>7. In this way, with her big eyes open, she
sees and catches rats and mice that come out of
their holes in the night to get something to eat.</p>

<p>8. My kitty loves to sleep in the day-time on
the nice bed in her basket, or on the rug before
the fire. In summer she likes to go out and get
a nap on the grass in the shade of a tree.</p>

<p>9. In the night, when she can see so well, she
goes out to hunt and to make visits. When visitors
come to see her in the night, we often hear an
awful squalling, which I suppose is a “cat’s concert.”</p>

<p>10. In cold, winter nights, kitty mews to be
let in, and she then likes to curl up on my bed.</p>

<p>1. Nobody knows where Miss Muffet came
from. She walked into the kitchen one day and
took her place by the warm fire, and she has been

<p>2. Miss Muffet is a yellow-and-white cat. She
is very quiet; but she likes fun for all that, and
many a play the children have had with her.</p>

<p>3. When pussy had been with us about a year,
we found her one bright May morning under the
hedge in the garden with four tiny little kittens.</p>

<p>4. We got a basket and made a nice bed for
them, and took them into the house. They grew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
up to be playful kittens; but one day poor Tinykins
fell into a tub of water and was drowned.</p>

<p>5. We liked
Fluffy the best; she
looked so wise and
would do such
queer things. We
found her one day
sitting in front of
a large open book,
and looking for all the world like a girl learning
her lessons.</p>

<p>6. At other times she would sit all alone as if
she were thinking over some very serious matter.</p>

<p>7. One day we found them all
in the barn, where pussy had gone
to teach them to hunt mice.</p>

</div>

<p>8. We found that Miss Muffet
had caught a mouse, and put it
before the kitties, and Fluffy was
just ready to pounce upon it as
we came in. We gave a great
shout; two of the kittens sprang back to their
mother, and one rushed head first into a large boot
that lay in one corner, and the mouse got away.
Here is the story in verse:</p>

<p>1. Now that Jessie has told us so much about
her cat, we would like to hear about a dog. John,
can you tell us something?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>2. Yes! The dog in this picture is an old
watch-dog. He is sitting by the chair, waiting for
his master, and taking care that nothing is stolen
from the room.</p>

<p>3. Our old dog Rover is always waiting for
me when I get home from school, and the way he
runs and jumps and barks, you would think he
wanted to eat me up.</p>

<p>4. When I throw a stick he will run and bring
it up, and if I try to get it he will hold on and
growl, and pretend to be very angry; but he wags
his tail and winks at me, to let me know that he
is only in fun.</p>

<p>5. He is a good friend to our old Tabby and
her kittens; but when a strange cat comes about,
away he goes after her like the wind, barking
with all his might. Then the cat goes up the
nearest tree and spits at him.</p>

<p>6. When the children are at play, he follows
them about to take care of them. He will lie
down in the shade and go to sleep; but he keeps
one eye open, and if anybody comes along, he is
up at once to see if anything is the matter.</p>

<p>7. He loves to play with the children, and
every day when nurse goes out with the baby, she
gives him a ride on old Rover’s back.</p>

  <p class="caption">Nero.</p>
</div>

<p>1. Nero was a dog that slept in a kennel in
the yard to keep watch in the night, so that no
thieves would come about and steal.</p>

<p>2. One night he followed his master up-stairs
to his bedroom. The servant turned him out; but
he howled and scratched at the door, and, when he
was driven away, he soon came back.</p>

<p>3. At last his master, curious to see what he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
would do, ordered the door to be opened. The
dog at once rushed into the room, and, giving a
little, short bark, by way of thanks, he crawled
under the bed, as if he meant to stay there.</p>

<p>4. The master thought the dog acted rather
strangely; but he soon forgot all about it, and, at
the usual time, went to bed.</p>

<p>5. In the middle of the night a great noise in
the room woke the master, and he got up to see
what was the matter. There, on the floor, was a
man flat on his back, while Nero stood over him
growling in a way that said, “Lie still if you wish
to keep a whole skin.”</p>

<p>6. The man was tied and taken to prison, and
he proved to be a robber who had come to steal
the master’s purse, and perhaps to kill him.</p>

<p>7. What made the dog leave his own bed and
go up to the room of his master nobody knew; but
he seemed to think that his master was in danger,
and so he went up to help him.</p>

<p>8. You may be sure that Nero was well treated
after this, and he could sleep where he pleased;
but he went back to his kennel, as though he
knew it was his place to keep watch out-of-doors.</p>

<p>9. He lived to be a very old dog, and he had
the best of care until he died.</p>

<h3><i>HOW DOGS LOOK.</i></h3>

</div>

<p>1. Well, John, we shall be glad to hear something
more about your dog to-day.</p>

<p>2. Here is a picture of Rover with a bird in
his mouth. He has been trained to find the game
that has been shot, and bring it to his master.
When he takes the bird he is careful not to bite
it.</p>

<p>3. Rover has a thick coat of long hair. It is
not so fine as that of a cat, but it is enough to
keep him warm in cold weather.</p>

<p>4. The cat has a round head, but Rover’s head<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
is long and his nose is blunter than that of the
cat. Rover’s ears are a great deal larger than
those of a cat, and they hang down by the side of
his head. Some dogs have ears that stand up and
point forward.</p>

<p>5. My sister has a little white terrier, Gyp,
whose hair is silky and much longer than Rover’s,
and it hangs down over his eyes in a very funny
way. He can see very well for all that.</p>

<p>6. Dogs do not hunt for rats and mice; but if
a rat comes in sight when Gyp is about, he gives
one bound and a snap, and there is a dead rat.
When Gyp is asleep, if we call out “rats,” he
springs up and rushes about as if he were crazy.</p>

<p>7. When the cat is angry she lashes her tail
from side to side, but when the dog is angry he
holds his tail out straight and stiff.</p>

<p>8. When the dog is glad he wags his tail as
though he would wag it off. When the little
black-and-tan dogs are very glad, you can’t tell
whether the dog or the tail wags most.</p>

<p>9. The cat does not like to go into the water,
but Rover likes nothing better than to swim out
after a stick which I have thrown in. In summer
he goes into the water every day to keep himself
cool and clean.</p>

<h3><i>WHAT MUNGO DID.</i></h3>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus30.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>1. Once on a time a miller had a large shaggy
dog called “Mungo.” He slept at the mill nights,
and took care that no thieves came about.</p>

<p>2. He was very fond of the children, and, when
baby pulled his hair with both her hands, he
looked pleased and would not let anybody know
how much she hurt him.</p>

<p>3. In the morning, Mungo would place himself
on guard at the upper doorway, while the miller
went to look after his work in the lower part of
the mill.</p>

<p>4. As soon as the miller came up, Mungo, without
being told, would start for the house to get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
his master’s breakfast. He made two journeys,
bringing a pitcher of milk and a dish of oatmeal
tied up in a napkin.</p>

<p>5. One morning there was a flood in the
river, and a little dog living near by fell into the
stream and was carried down yelping with all his
might.</p>

<p>6. Mungo was coming with his master’s breakfast,
as usual, when he heard the cry of the little
dog. He set the dish down by the side of the
path, and dashed off down stream as hard as he
could run.</p>

<p>7. When he had got well below the little dog,
he sprang into the river, and swam out into the
middle of the stream, just in time to catch the
helpless dog as he was swept down.</p>

<p>8. Mungo seized him by the neck in such a
way as to keep his head above water, swam with
him safely to the shore, and dragged him high and
dry out of the water.</p>

<p>9. After shaking himself, he cuffed the little
dog first with one paw and then with the other,
as much as to say, “Now, you little dunce, keep
away from the river.”</p>

<p>10. He then went back to where he had left
the dish, and carried it to his master as usual.</p>

<h3><i>HOW DOGS USE THEIR FEET.</i></h3>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus31" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus31.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>1. To-day, John, we should like to hear something
about the dog’s feet and how he uses them.
Have you something to tell us?</p>

<p>2. Yes! One way the dog gets about is by
swimming. Last summer little Harry fell into
the river when no one was near by, and Rover
swam in and brought him out.</p>

<p>3. The folks made a great fuss over him then;
but he did not mind it, only he seemed glad that
Harry was not hurt.</p>

<p>4. I find my dog has just as many toes as a cat.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
His nails are longer than those of the cat, but not
so sharp. They are big and strong, but he can not
draw them back into his foot.</p>

<p>5. He can not climb a tree, as his nails are not
sharp enough, but he can dig a big hole in the
ground when he is after a rabbit or a squirrel.</p>

<p>6. The bottoms of his feet are harder than
those of a cat, and he can run all day in rough
places without hurting them.</p>

<p>7. With his hard feet and long nails he makes
more noise when walking than a cat; but then it
is no matter, for he does not have to catch mice
and rats.</p>

<p>8. Rover can not open a door, but he raises his
paw and raps or scratches until somebody comes
and opens it for him.</p>

<p>9. Ask him to shake hands, and he will hold
out his paw as well as anybody can, though he
has not learned which is his right and which is his
left paw.</p>

<p>10. When Gyp is hungry, it is funny to see
him. He will whine a little, and then sit up
straight and hold out his paws like a little beggar.</p>

<p>11. Then, if you offer him something to eat, he
sniffs at it, and, if he does not like it, turns up his
nose and goes off. He likes candy as well as I do.</p>

<p>1. A dog with a fine bone in his mouth set
out to cross a stream on a narrow bridge.</p>

<p>2. As he was crossing, he looked into the water
and thought he saw another dog with a bone much
finer than his own.</p>

<p>3. Being a very greedy dog, he dropped his
own bone and made a snatch at the one he saw;
and so, by trying to rob another, he got a good
ducking and lost his dinner.</p>

<p>1. In a great city a man had a place near the
river, where he blacked boots and shoes.</p>

<p>2. To get more custom, he had a little dog who
would roll himself in the mud, and would then
rub against the feet of people as they passed by.</p>

<p>3. After a time the trick was found out, and
the man and his dog were sent away where they
could make a more honest living.</p>

</div>

<p>1. To-day we would
like to find out about a
dog’s mouth and teeth.
John, have you something
to tell us?</p>

<p>2. Yes! When playing
with Rover, last
night, he opened his
mouth, and I had a
good chance to see what
was inside.</p>

<p>3. His teeth are like those of the cat, only larger
and stronger, and his jaws are so strong that
tramps run away when he offers to bite them.</p>

<p>4. When Lion, the old bull-dog, gets his grip
on anything, the only way to make him let go is
to open his jaws with a bar of iron.</p>

<p>5. The cat uses both its claws and teeth in
catching game; but the dog can bite so much
harder, that he does not need sharp claws to help
him.</p>

<p>6. When a dog eats, he swallows large pieces
of meat without chewing, and he will crush a bone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
to get all the meat and the marrow inside. After
he has eaten off the meat, he often swallows the
bone.</p>

<p>7. His tongue is not so rough as that of a cat,
but he laps water and milk with it, and he loves
to lick the hands and faces of his friends.</p>

<p>8. In summer, when it is very warm, the dog
does not sweat as we do, but he opens his mouth
and pants, and the water runs off from his tongue.</p>

<p>9. When the dog is well, his nose always feels
cool; but if he is ill, his nose gets warm.</p>

<p>10. It is funny to see how old Rover will act
when some one comes around whose looks he does
not like.</p>

<p>11. He just stands up straight and his hair
begins to rise. Then he raises his upper lip so as
to show his long teeth, and gives a very low growl.</p>

<p>12. Next he steps forward a little and gives
two or three short and snappish growls, and then
somebody would better look out.</p>

<p>13. One day my mother was coming up the
lane, and met a tramp, who made a motion to take
hold of her. Rover made one spring, and his jaws
snapped. The fellow yelled, and, as he ran away,
he limped as though he had been hurt. Since
then he has not been about.</p>

<h3><i>LUPO AND TINY.</i></h3>

<div class="figcenter illowp60" id="illus35" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus35.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>1. “Lupo” was a very large dog with a thick,
white coat. He was so good-natured and faithful,
that his master felt that the children were safe
when Lupo was about.</p>

<p>2. In winter Lupo liked to stretch himself before
the fire, and, when he did so, he took up the
whole hearth-rug, and there was no chance for
any one else.</p>

<p>3. “Tiny,” the little terrier, liked the fire as
well as Lupo, but could find no place where it was
not either too cold or too warm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>4. So she would climb up on to Lupo, and use
him as a bed. It was very funny to see her tread
round and round, as dogs do when they make up
their bed, and then nestle down into his long hair
and go to sleep.</p>

<p>5. When Tiny had her bed all right, she would
not let Lupo move. If he stirred, she would fly
at his head and bark and growl in a most spiteful
way.</p>

<p>6. Then, if he did not stop at once, she would
bite his long ears, and Lupo would sink back and
lie as quiet as a lamb.</p>

<p>7. When out following the carriage, Lupo did
not seem to notice little dogs, and, when a half
dozen at once set upon him, he just shook them
off and kept on his way.</p>

<p>8. But he was not always so good-natured.
When a big dog came in his way, he seemed to
feel that it was a duty to whip him.</p>

<p>9. There would be a growl and a snap, and
away would go the other dog over Lupo’s head,
with a piece of his hide gone or some of his bones
broken.</p>

<p>10. As Lupo could not be broken of this habit,
whenever he went out his master would put a
muzzle on him so he could not bite.</p>

<p>1. I think John has something new to tell us
about his dog to-day. Let us listen to him.</p>

<p>2. I have looked at my dog’s eyes, and I find
that the pupil is round, like mine, and it does not
shut up into a streak, as in a cat.</p>

<p>3. The dog does not see so well in the night
as a cat, but his sense of smell is much more keen.</p>

<p>4. My uncle has a pointer-dog named “Grouse,”
and one day I went out with them to hunt quails.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>5. Grouse would run all about until he smelled
the birds, and then he would creep along a little
way and stand still with his nose pointing forward.</p>

<p>6. My uncle would then come up with his
gun, and, when he was ready, the dog would go
slowly forward scaring the birds up, when uncle
would shoot them.</p>

<div class="figright illowp87" id="illus37" style="max-width: 10.9375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus37.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>7. In this picture we see a dog pointing quails
among the reeds. The birds hear him, and are
just ready to fly.</p>

<p>8. A dog will follow the track of his master
for a long distance, and hounds will follow the track
of a wolf or a fox or a
bear, so that the hunter
can come up with
it and kill it.</p>

<p>9. Rover is a good
watch-dog, and, if he
hears or smells any
body about in the
night, he makes a great
racket.</p>

<p>10. He knows, too, where the other animals
belong, and, if a cow or a pig gets into the garden
or yard, he goes and drives it out.</p>

<p>1. Puff was a tiny little terrier and a great
pet. He came by his name from a way he had of
making a great fuss, and getting out of breath
about nothing. Baby was crazy to get hold of him,
and, when she saw Puff, she would wriggle out of
any one’s arms to get to him.</p>

<p>2. The children needed only say, “Baby, Puff
is coming,” when she would give a crow of delight,
and out went her little arms, fingers, and legs, all
working together.</p>

<p>3. But Puff’s hair was long and his skin tender,
and, when baby’s fingers got hold of him, his
howls were dreadful, and he never got away without
leaving some of his coat in baby’s fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>4. One day baby was asleep on the sofa, and
Puff thought it was a good time to look at her,
now that he could do so without fear. It was
funny to see him creep along, peering into the
little sleeping face, but ready to start back in a
moment.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus39.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>5. He went closer and closer, until his little
cold nose touched baby’s mouth, when she woke
with a sudden start, threw out her two little fat
hands, and seized him by the whiskers.</p>

<p>6. Puff pulled and howled and backed off the
sofa, dragging the baby after him; but she fell on
top of him, and was not hurt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<h3 id="LESSON_XXb"><i>PUFF AND THE RAT.</i></h3>

<p>1. When Puff would lie quite still out of doors,
with his nose pointed one way for a long time, the
children knew what was the matter.</p>

<p>2. There was a rat somewhere about, and Puff
had seen him go into his hole and was watching
for him to come out.</p>

<p>3. The boys would get a spade and begin to
dig, and, when they had got in a little ways, Puff
would take the matter into his own hand, and dash
into the hole.</p>

<p>4. His little, short paws would make quick
work, and he would dig in until even the tip of
his tail could not be seen.</p>

<p>5. Then a squeak would be heard, and Puff
would back out with a rat in his mouth, which he
knew what to do with to prevent being bitten
himself.</p>

<p>6. He would fling the rat into the air, and, as
it would come down, he would catch it by the nape
of its neck, give it a shake or two, and it was dead.</p>

<p>7. How proud he was then! He would lay
the rat down in different places to see where it
would look best, and then he would carry it round
to each one in the house, until somebody took him
and scrubbed the dirt off, so he was fit to be seen.</p>

<h3><i>HOW THE HORSE LOOKS.</i></h3>

<p>1. Here we have the picture of a boy and a
pony. The boy is taking a ride; but he has
stopped, and seems to be waiting for some one.</p>

<p>2. Now we must find out something about the
horse, and, Charlie, I think you can tell us what
we wish to know.</p>

<p>3. I can tell something how a horse looks and
what he can do, for we have horses at home, and
I help take care of them.</p>

<p>4. The horse is much larger than the cat or
dog. His home is in the stable, and he does not
come into the house, as they do.</p>

<p>5. His head is long, and, when he puts his nose
to the ground, the top of his head is just about as
high as the top of a flour-barrel.</p>

<p>6. His eyes are large and round; his nose is
much wider than that of a dog, but he has smaller
ears than some dogs, and they stand up straight.</p>

<p>7. Upon the top of his head, and along the top
of his neck, he has a thick bunch of long hair,
which is his mane.</p>

<p>8. He has a broad, strong back, and can carry
a man all day without being very tired. There is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
room upon his back for two persons, and some
times two ride at a time.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp50" id="illus41" style="max-width: 9.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus41.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">Full Speed.</p>
</div>

<p>9. He has long legs, so that his head is about
as high as the top of a man’s hat.</p>

<p>10. He is covered with a thick coat of short
hair, and this keeps him warm, except in very cold
weather, when he needs a blanket.</p>

<p>11. Instead of claws, he has hoofs, hard like
bone, so that it does not hurt him when he trots
or runs on the ground.</p>

<p>12. When horses work, or travel over a hard
road, they have iron shoes nailed to their hoofs, so
that they will not be hurt by striking the stones.</p>

<p>13. The hoofs have no feeling on the outside,
and it does not hurt the horse
to have these shoes nailed on.
They grow like our nails, and
must be pared once in a while.</p>

<p>14. The horse can paw
with his fore feet, and kick
with his hind ones, and, when
he kicks hard, he breaks
things. He has a tail covered
with long hair, and this he
uses as a switch to keep off
flies in summer.</p>

<h3><i>THE HORSE AND ITS FRIENDS.</i></h3>

</div>

<p>1. In some places men keep horses
to ride when they go out to hunt foxes, and
these horses are called hunters.</p>

<p>2. Dogs are also used in the hunt, and the
horses and dogs are so much together that they
often become the best of friends.</p>

<p>3. Once old “Hector,” a dog, had such a liking
for his friend “Ben,” the hunter, that he would
leave his own bed and go and sleep with Ben in
the stable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>4. In the morning when Hector was let out,
Ben would be very uneasy until he came back,
and, when he came, the horse would give a joyful
neigh.</p>

<p>5. Ben would stoop his head, and Hector would
lick it all over, and then Ben would scratch Hector’s
back with his teeth.</p>

<p>6. One day when they were out together a big
dog set upon Hector and threw him down, and
began to bite and tear him.</p>

<p>7. Ben saw the danger his friend was in, and
rushed forward to help him. The strange dog
felt a grip in the back, and then he was thrown
so far that he was glad to be able to get up and
limp away. He never tried to touch Hector again
when Ben was about.</p>

<p>8. Here is another story of a horse and his
friends: A poor stray kitten found its way into
a stable and made its home there.</p>

<p>9. It soon made friends with a lame chicken
and the pony, and the three were never quite
happy except when together.</p>

<p>10. It was very funny to see the kitten and
the chicken close together upon the pony’s broad
back, while he would stand very still so as not to
disturb them.</p>

<h3><i>HOW THE HORSE EATS.</i></h3>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus43" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus43.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>1. To-day we wish to find out something about
a horse’s mouth, and how he eats. Can you tell
us, Charlie?</p>

<p>2. Yes! I have looked at the horse’s mouth,
and can tell about his teeth. In front, on each jaw,
he has six teeth with sharp edges. These cut the
grass when he feeds in the pasture.</p>

<p>3. Next back of these are four sharp teeth, one
on each side of each jaw, and these are sometimes
called tusks. They are in the same place in the
jaw as the long teeth of the dog, and with them
the horse can tear things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>4. Next back of the large teeth there is a place
where there are no teeth, and this is the place
where the bit of the bridle goes
when we ride the horse or drive
him in a carriage.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp75" id="illus44" style="max-width: 9.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus44.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>5. Next back are six broad,
flat teeth, on each side of each jaw,
and with these the horse grinds
his food before he swallows it.</p>

<p>6. In summer, if our horses have not much
to do, we turn them out to pasture, where they
eat grass. In winter we give them plenty of
hay and oats, and, when they work, we always
feed them with grain.</p>

<p>7. Horses will eat grain of any kind, but they
seem to like oats best. We sometimes feed them
with corn-meal instead of oats.</p>

<p>8. The teeth of a horse change in looks every
year until he is eight or nine years old, and men
who are used to horses can tell how old they are
by just looking at their teeth.</p>

<p>9. The horse does not lap his drink like a
cat and dog, but he puts his mouth into the water
and swallows whole mouthfuls. He will sometimes
drink two or more large buckets of water at
a time.</p>

<h3><i>HOW THE PONY GOT SHOD.</i></h3>

</div>

<p>1. “Billy” was a fine pony, brought from
Shetland for a little boy to ride to and from
school, as the distance was too great to walk.
When Billy first came he was barefoot, and when
he began his daily journeys he was shod for the
first time.</p>

<p>2. The blacksmith who put on the shoes lived
quite a long distance from Billy’s home, and the
pony had never been over the road but on the
day he went to be shod. A few weeks after, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
blacksmith saw Billy, without halter or bridle,
coming up the road toward the shop.</p>

<p>3. Thinking the pony had strayed away, the
blacksmith turned him round, and threw stones at
him to make him go
back toward home.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp75" id="illus46" style="max-width: 18.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus46.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>4. The pony trotted
off; but the
blacksmith had only
fairly got to work
again, when he heard
a noise, and, looking
up, there stood Billy
at the door.</p>

<p>5. This time, before
driving him away,
the blacksmith took a look at his feet, and found
that Billy had lost a shoe. He at once made a
new one, and put it on, and then waited to see
what Billy would do.</p>

<p>6. The pony looked at the blacksmith for a
moment, as if asking whether he was done; then
he pawed, to see if the new shoe was all right,
gave a neigh for a “thank you, sir,” and set off
for home on a brisk trot. His master knew nothing
about the matter until next day.</p>

<p>1. To-day we are
to find out what the
horse is good for.
Charlie will tell us
whether the horse is
of any use on the
farm.</p>

<p>2. We could not
get on very well
without horses on
the farm. They are
very strong, and will
do a great deal of
work that a man can
not do.</p>

<p>3. They carry us on their backs, and draw
great loads that half a dozen men could not
move.</p>

<p>4. With them we plow and harrow and prepare
the ground for planting. If we did not have
horses, or other animals that can do the same kind
of work, a man could only plant a little patch that
he could dig up with a spade.</p>

<p>5. They draw loads of grain and fruit to market,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
and bring back what is needed on the farm.
They draw in the hay in summer and bring up
the wood in winter. They take to market the
things which we raise on the farm, and bring back
the goods which we buy at the store.</p>

<p>6. They will work from morning till night, in
all kinds of weather, and are ready to get up and
be off whenever they are needed.</p>

<p>7. When they have a heavy load, they walk
along slowly; when a light one, they trot along
quite rapidly. But if the doctor is needed, somebody
jumps on the back of a horse, and off he
gallops like the wind.</p>

<p>8. Then we harness the horses to a light wagon
and take a ride; sometimes we go on a visit, sometimes
to mill, sometimes on a picnic, and on Sundays
we go to church.</p>

<p>9. In the winter, when snow is on the ground,
horses draw sleighs instead of wagons. The sleigh
makes but little noise in slipping over the snow,
and a string of bells is put upon the horse to let
people know that the sleigh is coming, so that no
one need be run over.</p>

<p>10. When we go out sleigh-riding, all wrapped
up in blankets and robes, the horses scud along,
the bells jingle, and we have a gay time.</p>

<p>1. Horses, when they do not work too hard,
love to play and have fun. They will race after
each other, kick up their heels, and have a merry
time. Here are two stories which a man tells of
the kind of fun that the horse seems to enjoy:</p>

<p>2. “One of our horses, ‘Billy,’ used to give us
a great deal of trouble, he knew so much. He
had found out how to untie his halter, and open
the stable-door, and so would get out when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
door was not locked. One day Billy came out,
and found little Harry in the yard. He did not
attempt to hurt the child, but drove him into a
corner, and kept him there by shaking his head
whenever the little fellow tried to get away.</p>

<p>3. “I heard Harry cry, and led Billy away;
but he gave a parting shake of his head to the
boy, as much as to say, ‘Next time I will look
after you closer.’</p>

<p>4. “Coming home one evening, I heard a couple
of horses running and frisking about in the farm-yard
at a great rate. The wall was high, and I
could only see their heads, and once in a while a
whisk of their tails.</p>

<p>5. “I found a hole to look through, and saw
that the horses were amusing themselves by chasing
a pig around the yard.</p>

<p>6. “They would drive it into a corner, and
fling their heels into the air with great delight.
They would not give the poor pig a moment’s
rest.</p>

<p>7. “They would rest for a few minutes, and
the pig would settle down to his cabbage-leaf,
when they would rush at him from different sides,
so that he had not the least idea where to run to
get away from them.”</p>

<h3><i>HOW THE HORSE SHOULD BE TREATED.</i></h3>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus49" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus49.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>1. We see, from what Charlie has told us, how
useful the horse is. We now would like to have
him tell us how we should take care of horses.</p>

<p>2. I will do so by telling a story. Last Saturday
Uncle William hitched old Major and Ben to
a big wagon, and took a load of boys to Oak Hill,
to pick berries and have a good time.</p>

<p>3. I tell you uncle knows what boys and horses
want, if anybody does. Pretty soon Bobby Jones
wanted to drive. So uncle gave him the reins.</p>

<p>4. Bobby wanted the whip, too; but uncle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
said that we should not whip the horses, as they
went fast enough. He carried the whip just to
touch them up when there was any danger.</p>

<p>5. Then Bobby began to jerk the reins; but
uncle showed him how the horses would move one
way or the other by pulling the rein a little, and
he told Bobby that jerking hurt their mouths.</p>

<p>6. When we went down Stony Hill, just before
we came to the long bridge, uncle took the
reins, and drove slowly, because, he said, it would
make the horses lame to drive fast down hill.</p>

<p>7. As we were crossing the bridge, uncle
jumped out to see what was the matter with old
Major, who was limping a little, and he found one
of his shoes was loose. Uncle pulled the shoe off,
and threw it into the wagon, and then walked the
horses until we came to the blacksmith’s shop, on
the other side of the bridge.</p>

<p>8. Then they took old Major into the shop,
and the blacksmith pared the hoof and set the
shoe. In nailing on the shoe, he said he must be
careful not to drive the nails too far in where the
hoof was tender, or it would make the horse lame.</p>

<p>9. In going up Oak Hill, uncle would stop the
horses every little way to let them rest. They
would pant for a minute or two, then take a deep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
breath and go on. There was a cool spring close
by, where we stopped to go into the berry-field, and
here we hitched the horses in the shade.</p>

<p>10. They were very warm and thirsty, but
uncle would not give them any water until they
had time to cool. The flies were awful, but our
horses switched them off with their long tails.</p>

<p>11. Near by was a little bob-tailed horse turned
out to pasture; and, as he could not switch off the
flies, they bit him so he could hardly get time to
eat. If the man who owned that horse could have
the flies bite him so for a few days, I don’t think
he would cut off the tail of another horse.</p>

<p>12. We just filled our baskets with berries, and
ate our dinner under the shade of some big trees
that stood by the spring. Then we came home.</p>

<p>13. Uncle’s horses are steady, because he uses
them well. He never jerks them, or whips them,
or yells at them. When he goes near them they
rub their noses against him, they are so glad to
see him.</p>

<p>14. In winter he puts blankets on them when
they stand still, for he says their coats are not
thick enough to keep them warm. Then he gives
them a good bed of dry, clean straw to lie on, and
plenty of hay and grain to eat.</p>

</div>

<p>1. On the other page we
see a boy on the back of a
donkey, taking a ride. The
donkey looks kind and steady,
but look below and see what
has happened!</p>

<p>2. We will call upon Harry
to tell us something about
the donkey—how he looks, and
what he can do.</p>

<p>3. The donkey is much
like a horse, only smaller.
His head is larger and more clumsy than that of
the horse, and his ears are much larger.</p>

<p>4. His nose is blunter than that of a horse, and
his legs are shorter. He has some long hair
between his ears, but no mane on his neck. His
tail is long and slim, with long hair only on the
end of it.</p>

<p>5. His feet have hoofs like those of a horse,
but they are smaller, and he can travel in many
places where a horse can not.</p>

<p>6. His coat is longer and thicker than that of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
the horse, and he can get along with much less
care. He goes along with his head hanging down,
as if it was too heavy for him to hold up, and he
looks very awkward beside the horse.</p>

<p>7. He has teeth like those of a horse, so that
we can put a bit in his mouth when we drive him.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp60" id="illus52" style="max-width: 18.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus52.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>8. In color, most
donkeys are brown, or
a dirty white, with a
black stripe along the
back, from the head to
the tail, and also a
black stripe across the
shoulders.</p>

<p>9. When the horse
neighs, his voice is very
pleasant; but the donkey’s
bray is loud and
harsh, and when he
opens his mouth his voice is heard above all others.</p>

<p>10. I read the story of a man riding a donkey
in the West, when the Indians caught him.
As they were about to carry him off, the donkey
gave an awful loud bray, which scared the Indians,
so that they ran away and left the man to go on
his journey.</p>

<p>1. Poor, old donkey! In some countries he is
made to do all kinds of hard and dirty work, and
he is driven about with many blows and kicks.</p>

<p>2. The rag-man, in the city, picks up a load
for him out of the gutters; and the tinker, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
goes about mending old pans and kettles, loads
him down with heavy tools.</p>

<p>3. There are people that have no homes, but
rove about and drive donkeys in queer little carts,
and camp by the way-side, and sleep out-of-doors.</p>

<p>4. For them a donkey is better than a horse,
for he can live upon coarse food. He eats thistles
and weeds that a horse will not touch; and he will
pick up enough to eat where a horse would starve.</p>

<p>5. In places by the sea-side, or among the
mountains, where people go to stay in hot weather,
donkeys are kept for ladies and children to ride.</p>

<p>6. In the morning, long rows of them will stand
waiting for ladies to come and hire them. They
are so kind and steady, that there is no danger to
the little children who ride them.</p>

<p>7. The donkey is very sure-footed, and will
carry his rider safely over steep and stony places
where a horse can not go. Poor, old donkey! He
looks stupid, and he is slow. But, when treated
kindly, he is a very willing and faithful servant.</p>

</div>

<p>1. The donkey is not as stupid as he looks, and
he has often shown that he knows what he is
about, and that he is able to take care of himself.</p>

<p>2. In the picture we see a little girl with a
donkey going to market, and as Dick is always
treated kindly, he is ready to do all he can for her.</p>

<p>3. A man who bought a donkey for his children,
tells this story of him: “I did not allow him
to be pounded, and he got something better to eat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
than thistles. My donkey proved to be no fool;
but, like others, who have more wit than good
manners, he was forever getting into mischief, and
leading others into it.</p>

<p>4. “He could open all the gates, and climb all
the fences; and many a morning he woke me by
braying in the midst of my field of wheat. I was
obliged to sell him, as he knew too much about
doors and gates, and was too cunning to be
kept.”</p>

<p>5. A man once set his bull-dog to attack a
donkey that was grazing near the river. For a
while the donkey kept his heels toward the dog
in such a way that the dog could not get at him.</p>

<p>6. Watching his chance, the donkey turned and
seized the dog by the nape of his neck, so that he
could not use his jaws, then dragged him to the
river, plunged him in, and lay down upon him, keeping
his head under water until he was drowned.</p>

<h3><i>HOW THE COW LOOKS.</i></h3>

</div>

<p>1. Among our four-footed friends the cow
comes next, and we wish to find out something
about her. Will, do you think you can help us?</p>

<p>2. Yes! Since we began these lessons I have
watched our cows, and have found out some things
that I did not know before.</p>

<p>3. The cow has a heavier body and shorter
legs than a horse. She has a short neck, and a
long tail, with a bunch of coarse hair on the end<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
of it. Her head is larger than that of a horse, and
her nose is wider. Her ears stand out on each
side of her head, and above them she has a pair of
horns that spread out.</p>

<p>4. Her hoof is not round, like that of a horse,
but is split into two parts, and is called a cloven
hoof. She has a thick coat of coarse hair, which
keeps her warm in all but the very coldest
weather.</p>

<p>5. In front, the cow has six teeth on her under
jaw, but none on her upper jaw. In place of teeth
is a ridge hard as a bone. In the back part of her
mouth she has six broad, flat teeth on each side
of each jaw, with which she chews her food.</p>

<p>6. Cows are of different colors. Some are
red, some are black, some are white, and some are
spotted or striped. I have seen one kind that
looked like a black cow with a white blanket on.</p>

<p>7. When the cow eats grass, she swallows it
without chewing. When she has enough, she
stands still or lies down, and the grass comes up
into her mouth in little balls, and these she chews
fine and swallows again.</p>

<p>8. The ball she chews is called a “cud,” and
she will chew one cud after another, until she has
chewed up all the grass she has eaten.</p>

<h3><i>WHAT CATTLE DO.</i></h3>

<div class="figcenter illowp93" id="illus60" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus60.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>1. The ox is very strong, and can do work like
a horse. When oxen are used, two are put together
with a wooden yoke on their necks.</p>

<p>2. Oxen can draw large loads, and can work a
long time without being tired; but they are so slow
that they are not used much, except on farms.</p>

<p>3. In summer, cattle run in the pasture and
live upon grass. They gnaw it off close to the
ground, and they feed most of the day.</p>

<p>4. In the middle of the day, when the weather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
is hot, they lie down in the shade, or stand up to
their knees in the water, to keep cool.</p>

<p>5. At night the cows are driven to the farm-yard
and milked, and in the morning they are
milked again and driven back to the pasture.</p>

<p>6. In winter, cattle are kept in the stable, or in
the farm-yard where there is a shed that they can
go into when it storms or is very cold.</p>

<p>7. They are fed with hay; but cows that give
milk, and working-oxen, are fed with grain also.
Beets and turnips are sometimes fed to cattle.</p>

<p>8. When cattle stand in the shade chewing
their cud, there is no other animal that looks so
mild, and pleasant, and happy.</p>

<p>9. The cow is very fond of her calf, and licks
it over several times a day. If anybody hurts the
calf, he must look out for the old cow’s horns.</p>

<p>10. I have heard of a little lamb that had lost
its mother, and was put into a lot with six cows.
After a time he was taken out and put with the
other sheep. But they all fought him, and he
was sent back to his old pasture.</p>

<p>11. The cows all rushed up to meet him, and
he ran to each in turn. Then one cow licked him
all over, and he was passed to the next, and so on
until all had done the same thing.</p>

<h3><i>WHAT CATTLE ARE GOOD FOR.</i></h3>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus61.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>1. Cattle do not hunt rats and mice like the
cat, nor watch like the dog, nor do we ride them
as we do a horse or a donkey; but in some ways
they are more useful to us than any of the others.</p>

<p>2. When Johnny sat down to breakfast this
morning, a cow gave him that bowl of fresh, rich
milk, which he ate with his bread. Then, when we
drank the nice cup of coffee that mamma had made,
the cow gave us the cream which we put into it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>3. When the dinner was put up for school, the
cow gave the cheese and the butter that was
spread upon the bread. In the nursery rhyme
“Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet, eating the
curds and whey” which the old cow gave her.</p>

<p>4. This morning Johnny’s hair was in a snarl,
and mamma got it out with the help of the old
cow, who gave the horn to make the comb.</p>

<p>5. When we go out in wet weather, the cow
gives her hide to be made into the leather out of
which our coarse boots are made; and the calf
gives its hide for our fine boots and shoes.</p>

<p>6. When our new room was plastered, a little
while ago, the cow gave the hair to mix with the
mortar, so that the plaster would stick together
and stay on the wall.</p>

<p>7. Before we get our chairs and tables, the
cow takes off her hoofs and gives us the glue
with which they are put together. Then Santa
Claus could not bring Johnny his white-handled
knife till the old cow had given a bone for the
handle.</p>

<p>8. “Sleepy-head goes to bed” at night, and
the candle he carries is another present from the
old cow. The flesh of grown cattle that we eat
we call beef, and the flesh of calves, veal.</p>

<h3><i>HOW THE SHEEP LOOKS AND LIVES.</i></h3>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus62" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus62.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>1. We will now take a look at our friend, the
sheep. See it stand there, looking so kind, and
harmless, and innocent!</p>

<p>2. The sheep is much smaller than a cow, and
in size is like a large dog. Its nose is more pointed,
and its ears are smaller, than those of a cow. It
has small, cloven hoofs, and it eats grass and chews
its cud in the same way that a cow does.</p>

<p>3. Its jaws are like those of a cow, with no
teeth in its upper jaw in front, and with broad,
flat chewing teeth back. Like a cow, it feeds upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
grass in the summer, and upon hay and grain in
the winter.</p>

<p>4. The rams have large horns that twist about
in a very curious way. Lambs are playful, like
kittens, and they hop and
frisk about, and they
sometimes have great
games with old Rover
or with the cat.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp75" id="illus63" style="max-width: 18.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus63.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">Head of Merino Ram.</p>
</div>

<p>5. Sheep are
covered with a
thick coat of
wool, and this
keeps them
warm, so that they
can live out-of-doors
in the coldest weather.
In summer their “fleece” of
wool is sheared off. The
wool is made into cloth, and the cloth is made
up into clothes for folks to wear, so that the coat
of a sheep makes the coat for a boy.</p>

<p>6. Besides our clothes and blankets, the sheep
gives us fine, thin leather to bind books and make
gloves, and tallow to make candles and soap. The
flesh of sheep, which we eat, is called mutton.</p>

<h3><i>THE WAYS OF THE SHEEP.</i></h3>

<div class="figcenter illowp78" id="illus64" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus64.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>1. Sheep appear very helpless, but when they
run wild they know how to take care of themselves
very well.</p>

<p>2. They butt with their heads, and the large,
old rams will run very fast, and strike a fearful
blow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>3. When a flock of wild sheep is feeding, one
is placed at some distance out on each side, to keep
watch.</p>

<p>4. If an enemy is seen, the guards give a kind
of whistle, and the whole flock scuds away to the
rocks on the mountain.</p>

<p>5. If they can not get away, they place the
lambs in the center of the flock, and the old sheep
face outward, the biggest rams in advance.</p>

<p>6. When the fox or the dog is within a few
yards, the rams rush at him, and they are nearly
always successful in killing or driving him away.</p>

<p>7. The ewe has so strong a love for her lamb,
that she will face any danger to protect it.</p>

<p>8. One day a shepherd saw a fox in a high,
rocky place, trying to get a young lamb; but the
old ewe kept her head toward the fox, and gave
him no chance.</p>

<p>9. At last the fox made a spring and seized the
lamb, and at the same time the ewe struck him
with her head, and they all went over the rocks
and were killed.</p>

<p>10. There are sheep in South Africa which
have tails so large and fat, that the people tie
them to small carts so that the sheep can get
about. The fat is used for butter.</p>

<h3><i>ABOUT GOATS.</i></h3>

</div>

<p>1. In many ways the goat is like the sheep.
It is about the same size, and has the same kind
of teeth and hoofs, and it eats the same kind of
food. It has a thick coat of hair. Some goats have
fine hair that is made into cloth and nice shawls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>2. All the goats have spreading, sharp horns,
and the billy-goat has a long beard, which hangs
down almost to the ground. The kids are playful,
like lambs, but they are shy, and do not like
to come near folks.</p>

<p>3. The goat is more active than the sheep; it
can run faster and jump
higher, and it climbs rocks
where a sheep can not go.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp46" id="illus66" style="max-width: 15.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus66.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>4. The billy-goat is apt
to be cross, and then he
runs and butts anything
he meets.</p>

<p>5. Like the cow, the
goat gives us milk, and
butter, and cheese. It also
gives fine leather for ladies’
shoes and for binding
books, and the kid gives
us soft leather which is made into gloves.</p>

<p>6. Goats do not live in large flocks like sheep,
but they go about three or four together, and will
pick up a living where a sheep would starve.</p>

<p>7. They are so sure-footed that they will climb
up the sides of steep rocks, wherever they can
find a place to put their little pointed hoofs.</p>

<h3><i>ABOUT PIGS.</i></h3>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus67.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>1. The hog is about as large as a sheep, but its
legs are shorter. It has a cloven hoof, but it does
not chew a cud like the sheep.</p>

<p>2. It has a long, blunt nose called a snout, and
this it can move about to smell something to eat.
It can use its snout, also, to root up the ground
for seeds and other food.</p>

<p>3. Its ears are large and lop over; and it has a
queer little curly tail. It has four large pointed
teeth, called tusks, and with these it can inflict
worse wounds than a dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>4. It is covered with coarse hair called bristles.
Brushes of nearly all kinds are made of the bristles.
The hog is kept warm not by its hair, but by its
fat, which lies just under its skin.</p>

<p>5. Swine eat almost all kinds of food, and they
eat a great deal and very often. When feeding at
a trough, they root each other out of the way, and
seem in a great hurry to get all they can.</p>

<p>6. When a pig is caught, or is hungry, it sets
up a fearful squeal, which is worse to bear than
the bray of a donkey.</p>

<p>7. When the pig runs out in a pasture, it roots
up the ground so much that a ring is put through
the thick edge of its snout; then, when he tries to
root, the ring hurts so he stops.</p>

<p>8. It is not best to meddle with little pigs,
and make them squeal, when the old sow is about,
for she is ready to fight for them at any time.</p>

<p>9. The flesh of swine is called pork, and when
salted and smoked it is bacon.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
